# DoReFa-Net in PyTorch

Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06160.

Partial implementation supporting 1-bit weights and k-bit activations only.

Contains a single example, on MNIST.



### Use with QNN-MO-PYNQ

The scripts trains a LeNet. For use with the Finnthesizer in my [QNN-MO-PYNQ Fork](https://github.com/mohdumar644/QNN-MO-PYNQ), run the ``pt2npz.py`` script to create a compatible NPZ archive.
